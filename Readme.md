# Archives of the Secretariat of the French Communist Party

Welcome to this repository, dedicated to preserving and showcasing the archives of the Secretariat of the French Communist Party (PCF). This project focuses on the earliest reports, dating back to September 1944. These documents are encoded in **XML** following the **TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)** standards.

## Historical Context

The French Communist Party (PCF) emerged as the most influential political force in France following World War II. In 1943, the French Section of the Communist International (PC-SFIC) dissolved, rebranding itself as the PCF. During this period, the party solidified its roots among the working class, rural populations, and intellectuals, ultimately securing 26.2% of the vote and 159 parliamentary seats in the 1945 elections.

The documents from the Secretariat do not detail the party's political decisions but instead illustrate how the organization structured itself in preparation for these pivotal elections.

## Presentation of the Sources

The collection consists of three meeting reports from the French Communist Party:

- **Doc 1**: September 4, 1944
- **Doc 2**: September 11, 1944
- **Doc 3**: September 18, 1944

These documents are preserved in the departmental archives of Seine-Saint-Denis:
**54 Avenue du Pr√©sident-Salvador-Allende, 93000 Bobigny, France.**

Each report spans two to three typed pages, detailing decisions, assignments, and the names of key agents involved.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Accessibility**: By digitizing and encoding these texts, the project seeks to make them widely accessible to the general public.
2. **Support for Historians**: Encoding names of agents, locations, and other details provides valuable tools for historians researching France's political and social landscape post-World War II.
3. **Open Source**: All XML files are published under an open license to encourage further research and scholarly use.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `~/ReunionPcfEncoding/`: Contains XML TEI files, an ODD file, and accompanying guidelines in HTML format.
- `~/Sources/`: Includes PDF copies of the original meeting reports.
- `~/Transcription/`: Features `.txt` transcriptions of the documents, prepared by the project team.
